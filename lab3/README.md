## üß© Feature Description Lab

This lab focuses on extracting robust and distinctive descriptors from image keypoints. Feature descriptors allow for matching points across frames, which is essential for visual SLAM, structure-from-motion, and image alignment.

### üß† Algorithms Covered

- **BRIEF** (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)  
  A fast, compact binary descriptor best used with detectors like FAST or ORB.

- **ORB** (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)  
  Combines FAST keypoint detection with an oriented version of BRIEF, providing rotation invariance.

- **SIFT** (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)  
  Generates high-dimensional descriptors that are robust to scale, rotation, and illumination changes.

- **SURF** (Speeded-Up Robust Features)  
  A faster alternative to SIFT with good performance and robustness.

- **FREAK** (Fast Retina Keypoint)  
  Inspired by human visual systems; provides compact and fast binary descriptors.

- **Others**  
  Additional or custom descriptors can be tested for comparative analysis.

### üéØ Objectives

- Learn how descriptors are constructed and what makes them robust.
- Match descriptors across image pairs to find correspondences.
- Analyze descriptor performance under transformations like rotation, scale, and noise.

üìÅ The lab includes code implementations, visualizations of matches, and performance comparisons for different descriptors.
