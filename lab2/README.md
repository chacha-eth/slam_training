## 🔬 Feature Detection Lab

This lab focuses on implementing and understanding various feature detection algorithms used in SLAM and computer vision. The goal is to extract and describe keypoints in images for tasks like matching, tracking, and mapping.

### 📌 Algorithms Covered

- **ORB** (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)  
  Efficient and rotation-invariant; widely used in real-time applications.

- **FAST** (Features from Accelerated Segment Test)  
  A high-speed corner detection method ideal for low-compute environments.

- **SIFT** (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)  
  Robust to scale and rotation; useful for accurate matching.

- **SURF** (Speeded-Up Robust Features)  
  A faster alternative to SIFT with good performance under scale and rotation.

- **Others**  
  Additional detectors or descriptors may be explored depending on the lab task.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the theory and working principles behind each algorithm.
- Compare the performance of detectors on different types of images.
- Apply these methods in the context of SLAM pipelines.
